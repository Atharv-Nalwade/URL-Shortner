# URL-Shortener

This is a simple URL shortener that takes a long URL and converts it into a short URL with minimal length. When the short URL is pasted in the browser, it will redirect to the original long URL.

# Acheived
- Implement Redis for caching to reduce response time for frequently queried URLs.
- Custom Short URL's

# Future Scope:
- Create a different branch and use atomic-write to handle concurrency (Sequelize handles atomic-write by default).
- Deploy the project.

Additional Future Scope Ideas:
1. Analytics and Tracking: Implement a system to track the number of times each short URL is accessed, providing valuable insights into user behavior.
2. User Authentication: Introduce user authentication and user-specific short URL management, enabling users to manage their own created short URLs.
3. QR Code Generation: Offer the ability to generate QR codes for the short URLs, making it convenient for users to share the links.
4. API Documentation: Create comprehensive API documentation to allow developers to integrate the URL Shortener service into their own applications.
5. Link Sharing Options: Integrate with popular social media platforms or messaging apps to allow users to directly share short URLs.
6. Security Enhancements: Implement additional security measures, such as rate limiting, to prevent abuse or misuse of the service.


Feel free to contribute to this project by suggesting improvements or working on the future scope features. Happy URL shortening!

# URL-Shortener

This is a simple URL shortener that takes a long URL and converts it into a short URL with minimal length. When the short URL is pasted in the browser, it will redirect to the original long URL.

## Future Scope:
- Implement Redis for caching to reduce response time for frequently queried URLs.
- Create a different branch and use atomic-write to handle concurrency (Sequelize handles atomic-write by default).
- Deploy the project.

Feel free to contribute to this project by suggesting improvements or working on the future scope features. Happy URL shortening!
